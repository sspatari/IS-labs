## Lab1 Information security attacks (MITM)

# Theory

**Active attack**: In this kind of attack, The Attacker attempts to alter system resources or destroy the data. The Attacker can change the data, etc.

**Passive attack**: Attacker attempts to gain
info from the system without destroying
the information. This attack is more like
monitoring and recognition of

**Man-in-the-Middle Attack**: The man-in-the-middle attack is a form of active attack where an attacker makes a connection between the victims and send messages between them. Thus, victims think they are talking directly to each other, but actually an attacker controls it. In this scenario, an attacker has been successful when it can impersonate a user. On the other hand, a third person between you and the person with whom you are communicating exists and he can control and monitor your traffic. Fortunately, some protocols can prevent it, like SSL.

**Denial-of-service attack (Dos)**: In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.

**Address Spoofing**: In computer networking, IP address spoofing or IP spoofing is the creation of Internet Protocol (IP) packets with a false source IP address, for the purpose of hiding the identity of the sender or impersonating another computing system. One technique which a sender may use to maintain anonymity is to use a proxy server.

**Packet Sniffer**: A packet analyzer (also known as a packet sniffer) is a computer program or piece of computer hardware that can intercept and log traffic that passes over a digital network or part of a network. Packet capture is the process of intercepting and logging traffic. As data streams flow across the network, the sniffer captures each packet and, if needed, decodes the packet's raw data, showing the values of various fields in the packet, and analyzes its content according to the appropriate RFC or other specifications.

# Practical work

**ARP spoofing** is a type of attack in which a malicious actor sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area network. This results in the linking of an attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. Once the attacker’s MAC address is connected to an authentic IP address, the attacker will begin receiving any data that is intended for that IP address. ARP spoofing can enable malicious parties to intercept, modify or even stop data in-transit. ARP spoofing attacks can only occur on local area networks that utilize the Address Resolution Protocol.
